# CODAS
The Official Code for "Cross-Modal Domain Adaptation for Cost-Efficient Visual Reinforcement Learning".

We have refactored the code for simplicity. It is being retested in all of the proposed experiments to keep the reproducibility. We will upload the code as soon as possible. You can also try the [dev](https://github.com/xionghuichen/CODAS/tree/dev) branch which is runnable on all MuJoCo tasks. The rest experiments on HMS tasks are expected to be done by the end of this year.
